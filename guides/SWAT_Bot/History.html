<p>
  For much of 2023, the bot had obsolete and rushed code. It certainly impressed people from around the army community, however. It was still one of the most powerful army bots of the time. There were a sufficient number of commands, enough to handle events. During the summer, the bot could fetch themed tactics when asked, and event leaders would be able to cancel a tactic. This feature was not widely used, as its use was discouraged.

  By winter, the bot had received a brief overhaul. Multiple features were introduced, including the well-known <dfn>Seasons</dfn> system in December. SWAT's economy flourished around this time.

  In spring 2024, the bot recontinued its development. Authorization tokens were introduced for polling through Google Forms. Later in the same year, <dfn>Division Command Elections</dfn> took place using Discord interactions.
