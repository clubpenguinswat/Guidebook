  There is much more you can do in this guidebook. You can view and moderate <span class="discord-channel" channelID="715198770413043854">ðŸŒ¨ã€‘general-chat</span> while accessing the guidebook, using the miniature in-app <a onclick="Discord.crate.toggle()">Discord integration</a>! You can copy internal links to headings to help a friend find a resource they need, and you can keep track of your reading history directly in the <a onclick="client.settings.open()">Settings</a> panel.
