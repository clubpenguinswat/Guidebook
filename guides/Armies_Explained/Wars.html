<h1>Armies Explained: Wars</h1>

<div class="warning">
  <b>ARMY LEAGUE APPLICATION</b>
  <p>
    The information presented in this article is published in respect to the <dfn>Club Penguin Armies</dfn> league. This means that all information in this article has been formulated keeping their system and rules in mind. Data might not be accurately applicable in other <dfn>army leagues</dfn>.
  </p>

<p>
  War is a conflict between armies in the army world, the same way wars exist in reality. Wars play a key role in the army community, interestingly.
</p>

<h2>What Is A War?</h2>

<p>
  A war is a conflict or fight between two or more armies and/or alliances. They begin from a list of terms ("war terms") announced by the invading army, and scale to battles. They can end if any of the conditions mentioned in the war terms are met, or if a <dfn>treaty</dfn> is signed between/among the parties.
</p>

<h2>War Terms</h2>

<p>
  The list of war terms is a set of conditions and rules applied to a war. The terms apply to both the parties. There is no limit to the number of terms an army can impose, but there are some rules against some unfair or incorrect approaches.
</p>

<div class="tip">
  <b>LIMITATIONS</b>
  <p>
    The <dfn>Club Penguin Armies</dfn> league limits what war terms can be enforced in a war. If a condition or rule is invalid, the whole term is invalidated, but not the entire war. It is also worth noting that war cannot occur during an active <dfn>grace period</dfn>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Below is an example of a list of war terms…</p>

<div class="textblock">
1. No allied attendance is allowed. Should there be allied attendance for battles, the battle is to be forfeited in favor of the other army.
2. No dual-enlistment attendance is allowed. Should there be dual-enlistment attendance for battles, the battle is to be forfeited in favor of the other army.
3. No external involvement (i.e. external attendance from people in other armies, assisting in leading for the parties involvements, and external declarations) is allowed. Should there be external involvement attendance for battles, the battle is to be forfeited in favor of the other army. Likewise, all external involvement declarations shall be declared null and void.
4. All battles have to be judged by officiated judges from Club Penguin Army Judges.
5. All invasions need to be scheduled 24-hours in advance with the Club Penguin Armies league and the invading army must notify at minimum one of the defending army's leaders in advance. Failure to do so will have the invasion be invalid.
6. No dirty tactics (including DDoSing, doxxing, and blackmailing). Any instance of this will result in the loss of the war.
7. No multilogging, botting, or toxic tactics. Any instance of this will result in a forfeit of the battle in question.
8. Once one side is 10 points in the lead of the other army, the war shall conclude and the leading army can declare victory. This is to prevent a long-drawn war with no conclusion—demotivating both sides.
9. No army is allowed to merge into any involved armies following this declaration and will stay in place until the war has concluded. Any merger will be deemed invalid.
10. Running or withdrawing from the war (i.e. an involved party unilaterally signifying they are no longer contending the war or no-showing 3 consecutively battles) will result in a victory for the invading party.
11. Any other map rules imposed by the Club Penguin Armies league will apply to this war.
12. No server transfers can be made during the course of the war.
13. Should neither sides no longer wish to continue the war, they may agree to a mutual NAP enforced by Club Penguin Armies.

<p>
  The above example was a list of war terms of a war off the map ("map-less war") during the <b>Eagre Foray III</b> war between SWAT and the Water Vikings in November 2024. This means that armies will have battles, but no land will be gained or lost.
</p>

<h3>Breakdown</h3>

<b>
  1. No allied attendance is allowed. Should there be allied attendance for battles, the battle is to be forfeited in favor of the other army.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This statement implies that <dfn>allied support</dfn> may not be used by any of the two parties. This term also states that if an ally is called to attend by any of the parties, the violating army will be disqualified from the battle and the other force will win the battle.
</p>

<b>
  2. No dual-enlistment attendance is allowed. Should there be dual-enlistment attendance for battles, the battle is to be forfeited in favor of the other army.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This statement implies that <dfn>dual-enlists</dfn> may not be used by any of the two parties. This term also states that if a dual-enlisted troop is called to attend by any of the parties, the violating army will be disqualified from the battle and the other force will win the battle.
</p>

<b>
  3. No external involvement (i.e. external attendance from people in other armies, assisting in leading for the parties involvements, and external declarations) is allowed. Should there be external involvement attendance for battles, the battle is to be forfeited in favor of the other army. Likewise, all external involvement declarations shall be declared null and void.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This term defines that external involvement (participation from non-contesting armies), including allies and visitors, is prohibited. It also states that individuals belonging to non-contesting armies may not assist in leading in any way. Moreover, it defines the war as a <b>one-versus-one</b> ("1V1") conflict, meaning no other party can join the war or declare on any of the contesting parties for the duration of this conflict.
</p>

<b>
  8. Once one side is 10 points in the lead of the other army, the war shall conclude and the leading army can declare victory. This is to prevent a long-drawn war with no conclusion—demotivating both sides.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This term defines the natural termination of the war. It states that the first army to win 10 battles will be declared the winner, and then the war shall conclude.
</p>

<b>
  10. Running or withdrawing from the war (i.e. an involved party unilaterally signifying they are no longer contending the war or no-showing 3 consecutively battles) will result in a victory for the invading party.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This term states what should happen if any one of the parties withdraw from the war. If any one of the sides surrender, or claim that they are no longer contending the war, the war will end, granting the opposite force victory. The war can also end if an army does not show up ("<dfn>no-show</dfn>") to 3 battles consecutively, allowing the other force to win.
</p>

<b>
  12. No server transfers can be made during the course of the war.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This term states that no <dfn>server transfers</dfn> can be made during the war. The war does not need to be a map war to prevent server transfers.
</p>

<b>
  13. Should neither sides no longer wish to continue the war, they may agree to a mutual NAP enforced by Club Penguin Armies.
</b>

<p class="indented">
  This term allows the war to end early. For the war to end early, both the sides have to sign a (peace) treaty, or a <dfn>non-aggression pact</dfn>.
</p>

<p>The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th terms from the above example were not necessary to be included by the declaring army, as CPA already enforces these terms in every battle and war, as per their <a href="https://cparmies.org/map-2024/map-rules">map rules</a>.</p>
