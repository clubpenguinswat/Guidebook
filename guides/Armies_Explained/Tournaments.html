  WHY DO ARMIES NEED TOURNAMENTS?
</b>

<p>
  Tournaments are competitive and cause interaction among armies. There are tournaments of different styles to bring armies to life and introduce more sportive moves among armies. They may also become a cause of war later on.
</p>

<b>
  WHO ORGANIZES TOURNAMENTS?
</b>

<p>
  Tournaments are organized by an army league. In SWAT's situation, we generally accept tournaments from the popular <b>Club Penguin Armies</b> army league. However, we also participate in tournaments organized by other leagues, including the <dfn>Club Penguin Army League</dfn> (CPAL).
</p>

<h2>How They Work</h2>

<p>
  A tournament is announced by the organizing army league, supposedly days prior. CPA announces the tournament roughly half a month before it begins. However, some popular tournaments take place periodically, allowing anyone to predict what and when the next tournament is taking place. CPA invites a set of armies that are registered with their league to participate in the tournament, and army leaders contact the league administrators confirming their participation in the tourney. After the registration deadline is reached, the army league will announce the list of participating armies, the dates, the seedings if it is a bracket-style tournament, and some important rules. About a week may should still remain till the first battle.
</p>

<p>
  The style of tournaments vary and there are multiple types of tournaments. There are one-battle tournaments, or meetups, such as the <dfn>New Year Bonanza</dfn> or the <dfn>Beach Brawl</dfn> tournaments. There may also be more popular tournaments, including the <dfn>Legends Cup</dfn> and the <dfn>Christmas Chaos</dfn> tournaments. These are <dfn>bracket-style tournaments</dfn>, which means that they follow a bracket system.
</p>
