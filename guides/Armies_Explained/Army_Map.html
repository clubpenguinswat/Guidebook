  <b>ARMY LEAGUE APPLICATION</b>
  <p>
    The information presented in this article is published in respect to the <dfn>Club Penguin Armies</dfn> (CPA) league. This means that all information in this article has been formulated keeping their system and rules in mind. Data might not be accurately applicable in other <dfn>army leagues</dfn>.

<p>
  The <b>army map</b> is a competitive, virtual globe that increases competition among armies. It is usually seen as the root of most wars. Each army can possess land responsibly.
</p>

<p>
  The army map can be seen as the real world map. Armies are also known as <b>nations</b>, because they can possess land on the map. However, owning land also raises the risk of experiencing a war in the future. This is because armies are typically interested in looting as much land as possible. This implies that, to own land, the army must be strong. Superpower armies might enjoy taking over land from smaller armies.

  This is the newest season of the map, which opened on <b>May 5, 2024</b>, and it followed a short <dfn>grace period</dfn>. This is also the second map run by the Club Penguin Armies league.
</p>

<h2>Elements of the Map</h2>

<p>
  The map is divided into a total of <b>250</b> territories. Territories are also known as <b>servers</b>, <b>lands</b>, or <b>pieces</b>. Interesting enclaves and islands are scattered around the map. There are a total of <b>6</b> continents…
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Legacy Lands</li>
  <li>New Westland</li>
  <li>Central Islands</li>
  <li>Eastern Glacial</li>
  <li>South Arctic</li>
  <li>Cold Islands</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The <b>Legacy Lands</b> is the most popular continent. It was the first continent to be dominated this season. Moreover, the names of all territories in this continent are named after original Club Penguin servers. These servers are also known for their historic importance, as they were competed for by armies many years ago. There are a total of <b>90</b> servers in the Legacy Lands.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, only the <b>Legacy Lands</b> continent is unlocked. Over time, CPA will extend the accessibility and unlock more territories. However, the <b>New Westland</b> continent is a <dfn>trophy continent</dfn>. This means that it is unlocked, but it is not part of land that an army can compete for, and all its <dfn>trophy lands</dfn> are permanently locked. New Westland was converted to a trophy continent following the conclusion of the <a href="https://cparmies.org/2024/09/29/club-penguin-armies-presents-project-conquest-blood-bowl/">Project Conquest: Blood Bowl</a> tournament in October 2024.
</p>

<div class="tip">
  <b>SERVERS ON CPA BATTLEGROUND</b>
  <p>
    All servers belonging to the <b>Legacy Lands</b> continent is shown in the server list on <dfn>CPA Battleground</dfn> in an alphabetical order. However, the first four servers, <b>Battleground</b>, <b>Klondike</b>, <b>Warzone</b>, and <b>Ice Breaker</b> are displayed first for convenience sake.
  </p>
</div>

<b>WHO CAN OWN LAND?</b>

<p>
  All armies can own land, and no <dfn>treaty</dfn> can oppose this right. Additionally, the <b>Club Penguin Armies</b> league, <b>CPA Battleground</b>, and <dfn>CPA Judges</dfn> can also own land. However, armies cannot invade these special territories, and they cannot declare war against these three special institutions.
</p>
