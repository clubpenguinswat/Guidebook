<h2 id="Recruitment_Regiment:About">About</h2>

<p>
  The <dfn>Recruitment Regiment</dfn> was established on Sunday, November 24, 2024, but its operations began on December 1 in the same year. The Regiment was first hinted at in <a href="https://www.clubpenguinswat.com/2024/11/incoming-transmission-from-fun-x-time/">an address</a> by Commander Fun X Time. A day later, the guidelines, structure, and working of the Regiment was defined in <a href="https://www.clubpenguinswat.com/2024/11/introducing-the-recruitment-regiment/">a website article</a>. Since then, the Regiment has been an integral part of the community. It follows a system of two divisions which rotate periodically. The working has been explained briefly in this article.
</p>

<h2 id="Recruitment_Regiment:Structure">Structure</h2>

<p>
  The Regiment is headed by the <b>President</b> and the <b>Vice President</b>, and is divided into two teamsâ€”the Recruiting Team and the Mentoring Team. Each team has a rougly equal number of members. However, the Recruiting Team may see more members, as a large volume of recruiters are required. The Presidency hosts recruiting sessions and leads them. They also record activity of members within the Regiment.

<h2 id="Recruitment_Regiment:Joining_The_Recruitment">Joining The Regiment</h2>

<p>
  The Regiment does not look at skill. It is open to everyone, including some non-staff members. A member must be of the rank <b>Master Specialist</b>, or higher, to join the Regiment. When joining the Regiment, a member is subject to completing the weekly requirements. If the requirements are not met in the first week, a warning is issued and the person will be notified. If the requirements are not met in the second week either, the person is removed from the Regiment. The person can reapply for the Regiment in 7 days.

  <b>ISSUING LEAVES FOR INACTIVITY</b>
  <p>
    If you feel you are going to be less active and will not be able to participate in the Regiment, open a post in the <span class="discord-channel">ðŸ’€ã€‘inactivity-reasons</span> forum channel in the SWAT Discord server. Upon the approval of a Recruitment Regiment head, you will be granted leave and you will not be removed from RR depsite inactivity. However, your inactivity reason must be reasonable enough. And, if you are not meeting the requirements for 4 weeks, you will be removed. In this case, you will not face the 7-day reapply cooldown. You can always reapply later.
