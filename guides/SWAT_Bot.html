<h1>SWAT Bot</h1>

<p>
  The <b>SWAT Discord Bot</b> is an extensive topic, and deserves a category of its own. It is a Discord bot built for community and army purposes.
</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>
  The Discord bot is built and hosted on the <a href="https://botdesignerdiscord.com/" target="_blank">Bot Designer For Discord</a> (BDFD) platform. It uses a very intricate codebase programmed in <b>BDScript 2</b>â€”which is the latest version of BDScript.
</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>
  SWAT Bot is currently not running on a premium plan of BDFD. Therefore, it relies on video advertisements for its uptime.
