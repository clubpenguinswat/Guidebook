<h1>Diplomacy</h1>

<p>
  In the realm of Club Penguin armies, <b>diplomacy</b> is an important topic. Diplomacy is the activity of curating external affairs and relations.

<h2>Etiquette In Other Armies</h2>

<p>
  When present in another army as a staff member, you should not bring in irrelevant or unnecessary drama. Avoid breaking rules in Discord servers of other armies. As a staff member in SWAT, you represent a face of the army. Armies to which SWAT is neutral or allied, should see more disciplined diplomacy. Your behavior may have some influence on a future international negotiation. This advice is not limited to army servers solely, but also army communities elsewhere, including the Club Penguin Armies Discord.
