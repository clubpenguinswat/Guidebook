<h2>Before You Lead</h2>
<p>
  Before you lead, you might want to check the following…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure you have unnecessary tabs and apps closed. Discord uses a lot of memory while leading, and other tabs and apps may consume memory.</li>
  <li>Have a stable Internet connection. If your connection is not powerful, we discourage you from leading. Leading tactics requires messages to be sent without delay. A latency below 250 milliseconds is ideal.</li>
  <li>Do not lead amid possible medical urgency. If you feel you might faint or face any medical issue during the event, such as puking, do not lead. It is difficult for you, the other event leaders, and troops.</li>
  <li>Have a set of tactics prepared or fetched beforehand. This should be sorted out before the <dfn>pre-room</dfn>.</li>
  <li>No drunken leading.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Guidelines</h2>

<p>
  When leading, keep the following in mind…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should not send a tactic more than once on Discord. It becomes difficult for some to copy the tactic.</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary talking on Discord, and encourage others to do so the same. This is to prevent the flow of the event from being intervened, and to help build focus.</li>
  <li>Try to stay connected to the voice channel and remain undefeaned. Important information may be shared to you via voice.</li>
  <li>Mention and ask idle and underperforming troops to become more active in the event and suggest them ways to improve. Prioritize this in training events.</li>
</ul>
