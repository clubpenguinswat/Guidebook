<h1>Essentials: Leading Events</h1>

<p>
  <b>Event leading</b> is an important skill required to lead an army. Without this talent, it is not possible to play the chess game of CPA Battleground. Remember, event leading is like playing the game of chess.

  <b>BEFORE YOU READ</b>
  <p>
    We suggest that you read the <a href="#Essentials/Attending_Events">Attending Events</a> article before continuing to read this article. Doing so will help you build better knowledge of event leading. If you already have visited that article, continue reading.

<h2 id="Essentials/Leading_Events:Before_You_Lead">Before You Lead</h2>

<p>
  Before you lead, you might want to check the following…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure you have unnecessary tabs and apps closed. Discord uses a lot of memory while leading, and other tabs and apps may consume memory.</li>
  <li>Have a stable Internet connection. If your connection is not powerful, we discourage you from leading. Leading tactics requires messages to be sent without delay. A latency below 250 milliseconds is ideal.</li>
  <li>Do not lead amid possible medical urgency. If you feel you might faint or face any medical issue during the event, such as puking, do not lead. It is difficult for you, the other event leaders, and troops.</li>
  <li>Have a set of tactics prepared or fetched beforehand. This should be sorted out before the <dfn>pre-room</dfn>.</li>
  <li>No drunken leading.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Essentials/Leading_Events:General_Guidelines">General Guidelines</h2>

<p>
  When leading, keep the following in mind…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should not send a tactic more than once on Discord. It becomes difficult for some to copy the tactic.</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary talking on Discord, and encourage others to do so the same. This is to prevent the flow of the event from being intervened, and to help build focus.</li>
  <li>Try to stay connected to the voice channel and remain undefeaned. Important information may be shared to you via voice.</li>
  <li>Mention and ask idle and underperforming troops to become more active in the event and suggest them ways to improve. Prioritize this in training events.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Essentials/Leading_Events:Formations">Formations</h2>

<p>
  Formations are key in battle. However, perfect formations require much practice. Complex formations require a lot of penguins, training. In exchange, complex formations give a large advantage in battles. Formations must also be chosen correctly. As you know, penguins have to cover the opponent and also ensure that the opponent is not able to sit south of them. This means that we need to try <b>counter formations</b>—formations that counter the opponent's.
</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Formation</th>
      <th>Counter Formations</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vertical Line (|)</td>
      <td>Horizontal Line (—)<br>Upside-down T (ꓕ)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Horizontal Line (—)</td>
      <td>Chatbar Formation (_)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T (T)</td>
      <td>Horizontal Line (—)<br>Upside-down T (ꓕ)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Upside-down T (ꓕ)</td>
      <td>Two Horizontal Lines (| |)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  To practice countering formations as a leader, hosting <b>practice battles</b> is a good option. Additionally, the SWAT Corporation recommends having at least 1 practice battle a week, ideally on the weekend, when possible.

<div class="tip">
  <b>ETHICAL LEADING</b>
  <p>
    While leading, you must ensure you are not breaking any rules in-game. Doing so may result in <dfn>Top Ten</dfn> deductions, banishment from the game, disqualification from a tournament, loss in war, battle results against SWAT, or any other penalty. If you send inappropriate tactics or use illegal formations on CPA Battleground, all senders may be punished in-game. Therefore, you must lead responsibly.

<div class="warning">
  <b>RELIGIOUS TACTICS</b>
  <p>
    As of <b>November 19, 2024</b>, sending religious tactics within SWAT has been disallowed. This is because religious tactics is the equivalent of forcing your sentiments on someone else. When it comes to training, too, consistency with tactics is required such that everyone sends the tactics. Sending religious tactics is opposing the idea of consistency.
  </p>
  <p>The ban on religious tactics within SWAT applies for all religions.</p>
