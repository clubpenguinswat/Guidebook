<h1>Mentoring</h1>

<p>
  <b>Mentoring</b> is the process in which a support member enlists and guides a recruit. It is important, because it helps the recruit be active and be helpful to SWAT. In very informal contexts, enlisting and mentoring may be used interchangeably.

<h2>Enlistment requests</h2>

<p>
  An <b>enlistment request</b> is a request of asking a recruit to enlist. Messaging newcomers with the vision of eventually enlisting them is the same as sending an enlistment request. Generally, a recruit should be messaged shortly after they join. It is a usual, indirect, and recommended approach to introduce them to the server first and describe what it is about, before actually asking them to enlist.

  If a recruit questions about CPA Battleground and its safety, let them know that they may fill out false or fictional information during account registration.
