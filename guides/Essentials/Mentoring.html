<h1>Essentials: Mentoring</h1>

<p>
  <b>Mentoring</b> is the process in which a support member enlists and guides a recruit. It is important, because it helps the recruit be active and be helpful to SWAT. In very informal contexts, enlisting and mentoring may be used interchangeably.

<h2>Enlistment requests</h2>

<p>
  An <b>enlistment request</b> is a request of asking a recruit to enlist. Messaging newcomers with the vision of eventually enlisting them is the same as sending an enlistment request. Generally, a recruit should be messaged shortly after they join, but not immediately. It is a popular and recommended approach to introduce them to the server first and describe what it is about, before actually asking them to enlist. Once you feel it is the right chance, ask them if they are interested in signing up as a SWAT troop ("enlist"). If they agree, send them either the CPAB game link or the registration page link. Help them create an account.

<p>
  If a recruit questions about CPA Battleground and its safety, let them know that they may fill out false or fictional information during account registration. Do not show desperation or force them to create an account, however. Try to show them the benefits of enlisting. A few benefits they may receive from enlisting have been listed belowâ€¦
