<h3 id="Essentials/Recruiting:Discord_Scouting_Explained/Messaging">Messaging</h3>

<p>To begin scouting on Discord, open a Discord server you wish to use for recruiting. Then, visit their main chat and look for active users. Select a user you have not messaged before and send your recruiting message in their DM. A few messages you may use for recruiting have been described in the next section in this article. However, before you send the message, make sure to check their mutual servers and ensure they are not already in another Club Penguin army Discord server.</p>

<div class="danger">
  <b>TROOPSTEALING</b>
  <p>
    When recruiting, you should ensure that the person you are trying to recruit is not already in a Club Penguin army. We encourage you to join army Discord servers on your recruiting account and let them know that you are a recruiting account sent from SWAT, joining to avoid accidentally <dfn>troopstealing</dfn>. Then, keep an eye on an the mutual servers you share with an individual you are recruiting. Do not recruit a member who is already present in a Club Penguin army Discord server.
