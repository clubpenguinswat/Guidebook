<p>
  There are multiple methods to recruit. You should always prefer a method that you feel you can bring the most recruits in, or you may try as many methods as possible. The methods have been listed below…
</p>

<ul class="dense-list">
  <li>
    <b>Discord scouting:</b> You may approach a few members in another Discord server, asking them if they are willing to join SWAT. Various approaches are followed for the purpose of recruiting. For example, you may use a hands-on approach and play with them, then ask them if they are interested in joining a server. Or, you may directly as them if they are willing to join SWAT.

<h2>Discord Scouting Explained</h2>

<p>

  <b>DISCORD SCOUTING</b>
  <p>
    For Discord scouting, we encourage you to use an alternate account [alt] on Discord. This is because you may be charged and possibly banned from a Discord server you may be recruiting in. Using another account secures you from incurring penalties on your main account, too.

<h3>Creating an account</h3>

  You can create an account on Discord, which you can utilize for Discord scouting. To achieve this, you will need to create an email address first. Creating a Google account works, but may be a lengthy process. You can quickly create an email account using <b><a href="https://account.proton.me/mail/signup?plan=free" target="_blank">Proton Mail</a></b>. After creating your account, set up a decent profile. It is not necessary for it to be attractive, but pick a casual theme.
