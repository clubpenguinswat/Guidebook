<h1>Essentials: Attending Events</h1>

<p>
  Attendance at events is necessary. You must also not be passive at events, and actively participate. Attending an event comes with some important notes that should be kept in mind. Please note that this article primarily focuses on events performed on <dfn>CPA Battleground</dfn>.
</p>

<h2 id="Essentials/Attending_Events:Vision">Vision</h2>

<p>
  In Club Penguin, army events have a vision, which lays the foundation of the concept of armies on this game. The goal of an army is to dominate a server by being its boss. To do so, an army often battles another army for land (or "server"). An army has to fight the other army using tactics. The army that is the fastest in sending tactics, and is the most noticeable, wins.
</p>

<p>
  However, how armies work have changed over time. The <b>Club Penguin Army Judges</b> organization has set <a href="#Documents/CPAJ_Judging_Guide" class="redirect">Judging Guidelines</a> regarding how battles should be judged and what criteria should be overseen. The following are some important factors that will be used to decide the verdict of a battle…
</p>

<ul class="dense-list">
  <li><b>Size:</b> The force or quantity of penguins sent by an army directly and indirectly influences the results of a battle. Size is a deciding factor of the battle verdict, and it also affects the quality of formations and speed of tactics.</li>
  <li><b>Tactics:</b> The speed of tactics being sent is looked at. Additionally, the uniqueness of tactics and their structure is a deciding factor, too. It is worth mentioning that tactics should not be repeated in an event.</li>
  <li><b>Formations:</b> Formations is key. Formations should cover the opponent, and individuals must spread out and be equidistant, such that maximum area is occupied.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For these goals to be achieved, every individual must cooperate in an event. The rest of this article will cover on how to participate and make the most out of an event or battle effectively…
</p>

<h2 id="Essentials/Attending_Events:Skills">Skills</h2>

<p>
  There are two important tactical skills—formations and tactics. When executed correctly, they yield battle outcomes in favor of SWAT. To brush up these skills, SWAT hosts training events multiple times a week, in most timezones.
</p>

<h3 id="Essentials/Attending_Events:Skills/Formations">Formations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a watch on the formation entirely, including others' positions, so you can ensure you are sitting in the best place.</li>
  <li>Do not bunch in a formation. For lower sizes, it is always ideal to spread out and be equidistant; do not sit too closely with another. Remember, our goal is to cover the opponent and be noticeable, and so spreading out largely helps.</li>
  <li>Formations should be entered into quickly, in less than 10 seconds ideally.</li>
  <li>Do not exit or move out of the prepared formation unnecessarily.</li>
  <li>Always stick to the very bottom of the game screen when you are in the <dfn>chatbar formation</dfn>, or if you are part of any horizontal line located at the bottom edge of the screen. This is to prevent an opposing troop from sitting south of you. This has been explained later in the next section.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Essentials/Attending_Events:Skills/Tactics">Tactics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep sending a tactic repeatedly ("spamming" or "holding") until the next one is invoked. This is to prevent gaps of silence between tactics.</li>
  <li>Always send the latest tactic. Do not send the previous tactic or earlier tactics.</li>
  <li>We do not encourage you to type a tactic manually, unless it is extremely short. We encourage you to use keybinds such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd> to copy and paste tactics in CPA Battleground.</li>
  <li>Do not respond to messages or tactics sent by other opponents in-game. Focus on solely your own tactics. Replying does not offer any advantage, and only acts as distraction.</li>
  <li>Your tactic may not be noticeable if you are sitting incorrectly. Always sit south of an opposing troop. If not possible, move slightly left or right of the opposing troop. Refer to the image below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Essentials/Attending_Events:Preloading_Rooms">Preloading Rooms</h2>

<p>
  It is a popular practice to preload rooms when room switches are set to happen. This is particularly tactical in battles. Preloading is the act of loading CPA Battleground's game files for a room. Doing so drastically decreases the time it takes to switch rooms.
</p>

<p>
  <b>How to preload a room?</b>
  <br>
  Before an event or battle, visit all common rooms. The rooms you visit will be preloaded behind the scenes. We recommend visiting all rooms on the Club Penguin Island map, and <dfn>Inside Dojo</dfn>, <dfn>Inside Mine</dfn>, and the <dfn>Underground Pool</dfn>. Once finished visiting all of them, return to the original room. Now, you should be able to switch rooms faster; the rooms you visited should have decreased loading time!
