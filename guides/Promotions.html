<h1>Promotions</h1>

<p>
  Promotions are incentives rewarded to an enlisted SWAT troop for attending an event.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ideally, promotions of an event should be completed in no more than 24 hours after the event. It is encouraged to complete promotions immediately after an event.</li>
  <li>Promotions of an event should not be done in less than 30 minutes after an event ends, unless you are confident that all attendees have submitted their names.</li>
  <li>Everyone, including staff members, should submit their name in promotions, even if they are not willing to receive a promotion. We have to track event attendance in our records internally.</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning">
  <b>COMPLETION</b>
  <p>
    All promotions should be completed before the month ends. This is because <dfn>seasons</dfn> need to continue, and a winner has to be determined for a season. The winner cannot be determined if promotions of all the events of the past month have not been finalized.
